# 👋 Hey, I'm Kirpa!

**I find patterns, build solutions, and chase impact through data.**

I live for that *"wait… we can solve this?"* moment. I'm obsessed with connecting the dots between raw data and real-world change, AND learning something new every time I do it.

---

## 🔍 What Drives Me

✨ I love:
- Digging into complex data and finding meaning
- Building usable, scalable tools, not just shiny models
- Tackling problems that matter to real people
- Picking up new tech like it’s a puzzle I *have* to solve

🔗 My goal is to bridge the gap between data science and real-world decisions — whether that’s for clinicians, city planners, or everyday users.
