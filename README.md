# 👋 Hey, I'm Kirpa!

**I find patterns, build solutions, and chase impact through data.**

I'm obsessed with connecting the dots between raw data and real-world change, AND learning something new every time I do it.

---

## What Drives Me

- Digging into complex data and finding meaning
- Building usable, scalable tools, not just shiny models
- Tackling problems that matter to real people
- Picking up new tech like it’s a puzzle I *have* to solve

**My goal is to bridge the gap between cutting-edge Technologies and the humans who actually use it.**
Whether it's translating the “black box” of AI agents into something stakeholders understand, or building interfaces that connect complex models to real-world impact, I bring the tech down to earth and make it make sense.

## Some of my Project Work:

### Facial Recognition System
*Real-time facial ID system using ResNet50 + Attention + Triplet Loss (~95% accuracy).*
→ Built FastAPI + React interface with 1:1 and 1:N matching
→ Roadmap: Improve fairness, speed, and deploy liveness detection

### Alzheimer’s Early Detection  
*Built 95% accurate models using clinical data from 2,149 patients.*  
→ Prioritized interpretability and bias checks.  
→ Exploring deployment as a clinical support tool.

### Pharma ML at Bristol Myers Squibb  
*Built real-time ML pipeline to replace expensive CFD simulations.*  
→ Developed FastAPI app for both technical + business users.  
→ Focused on scalability, stakeholder alignment, and future monitoring.

### NYC Pedestrian Safety Analytics  
*Mapped 3 years of crash data to spot danger zones in NYC.*  
→ Used geospatial tools to recommend Vision Zero policy changes.  
→ Planning real-time dashboards for urban planning.

### X-Scape: Accessible VR Escape Room  
*Led development of a multiplayer escape room for all abilities.*  
→ Combined Unity, haptics, and spatial UX design.  
→ Won 2nd place at VT HCI Symposium 🥈

## My future projects

I’m constantly leveling up — right now I’m diving into:
- Real-time ML monitoring + MLOps
- Explainability + fairness in predictive systems
- Agent-agents for Mental Health Support
- Interactive dashboards that *actually* make sense, and can update real-time

## A Few Fun Facts

- I unwind with music and cultural dance  
- I used to do competitive shooting (yeah, really)  
- You’ll find me hiking and reflecting when I'm not buried in code  
- I lead data workshops and advocate for DEI in tech
